A Local mosque, Masjid Al-ber, needed a website done. Went over what the mosque wanted to incorporate into the Website, created a design, and implemented it on their Wix site. This is a React app of the mosque website with an updated design. Uses HTML5, CSS3, JS, React, React-Router, React Icons and is deployed using Netlify.
